    "### **2.2.4 Eigenvalues**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Eigenvalues?\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvalues are special numbers associated with a matrix. In the context of multi-agent systems, they help us understand the behavior of the system, especially in terms of stability and dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are Eigenvalues Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stability**: Eigenvalues can tell us if the system is stable. If all eigenvalues have negative real parts, the system is stable.\n",
    "2. **Dynamics**: They help describe how the system evolves over time. For example, they can indicate how fast agents in a multi-agent system reach consensus.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a group of robots trying to align their directions. We can represent their interactions with a matrix \\( A \\). The eigenvalues of \\( A \\) will tell us how the directions of the robots change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Example\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Matrix Representation**: Suppose we have a matrix \\( A \\):\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   A = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "   2 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "   1 & 2\n",
    "   \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Characteristic Equation**: To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\text{det}(A - \\lambda I) = 0\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   For our matrix \\( A \\):\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\text{det}\\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "   2 - \\lambda & 1 \\\\\n",
    "   1 & 2 - \\lambda\n",
    "   \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Solve for Eigenvalues**: This simplifies to:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   (2 - \\lambda)^2 - 1 = 0 \\\\\n",
    "   \\lambda^2 - 4\\lambda + 3 = 0 \\\\\n",
    "   (\\lambda - 3)(\\lambda - 1) = 0\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   So, the eigenvalues are $( \\lambda_1 = 3 ) and ( \\lambda_2 = 1 )$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Eigenvalue \\( $ \\lambda_1 = 3 $ \\)**: Indicates a faster change in the system.\n",
    "- **Eigenvalue \\( $ \\lambda_2 = 1 $ \\)**: Indicates a slower change.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a multi-agent system, these eigenvalues help us understand how quickly the agents will align their directions.\n"
