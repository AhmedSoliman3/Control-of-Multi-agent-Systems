    "### 2.2.5 Jordan Canonical Form\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jordan Canonical Form (JCF) is a way to simplify a matrix into a form that reveals its structure more clearly. It's especially useful when a matrix cannot be fully diagonalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is it important?\n",
    "\n",
    "In multi-agent systems, JCF helps us understand the system's behavior, especially when dealing with complex dynamics and interactions between agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simple Example\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Matrix Representation**: Suppose we have a matrix \\( A \\):\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   A = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "   5 & 4 & 2 \\\\\n",
    "   0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "   0 & 0 & 3\n",
    "   \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Jordan Form**: The Jordan form of \\( A \\) is a block diagonal matrix \\( J \\) that looks like this:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   J = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "   5 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "   0 & 5 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "   0 & 0 & 3\n",
    "   \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   Here, the block $ \\begin{pmatrix} 5 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 5 \\end{pmatrix} $ is a Jordan block corresponding to the eigenvalue 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spectral Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Spectral Decomposition is a way to break down a matrix into simpler parts using its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Itâ€™s useful for understanding the influence of different modes in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is it important?\n",
    "\n",
    "In multi-agent systems, spectral decomposition helps in analyzing how different components of the system evolve over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simple Example\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Matrix Representation**: Suppose we have a matrix \\( A \\):\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   A = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "   4 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "   2 & 3\n",
    "   \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: First, we find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\( A \\):\n",
    "   - Eigenvalues: $ ( \\lambda_1 = 5 ), ( \\lambda_2 = 2 ) $\n",
    "   - Eigenvectors: $ ( v_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} ), ( v_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} ) $\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Spectral Decomposition**: We can write \\( A \\) as:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   A = P \\lambda P^{-1}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   where \\( P \\) is the matrix of eigenvectors and \\( $ \\lambda $ \\) is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   P = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "   1 & -1 \\\\\n",
    "   2 & 1\n",
    "   \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\lambda = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",

    "   0 & 2\n",
    "   \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "   $$\n",

    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the matrix \\( A \\):\n",

    "\\end{pmatrix} = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This simplifies to:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(5 - \\lambda)(1 - \\lambda)(3 - \\lambda) = 0\n",
