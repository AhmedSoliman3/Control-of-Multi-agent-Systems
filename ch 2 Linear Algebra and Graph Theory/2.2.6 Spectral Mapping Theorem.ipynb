    "### 2.2.6 Spectral Mapping Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "The Spectral Mapping Theorem is a fundamental result in linear algebra and functional analysis. It relates the spectrum (set of eigenvalues) of a matrix or linear operator to the spectrum of a function applied to that matrix or operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statement of the Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "If \\( A \\) is a square matrix and \\( f \\) is a complex-valued function that is analytic on the spectrum of \\( A \\), then the spectrum of \\( f(A) \\) is given by:\n",
    "$$ \\sigma(f(A)) = \\{ f(\\lambda) : \\lambda \\in \\sigma(A) \\} $$\n",
    "where \\($ \\sigma(A)$ \\) denotes the spectrum of \\( A \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "The theorem essentially tells us that if you know the eigenvalues of a matrix \\( A \\), you can determine the eigenvalues of \\( f(A) \\) by simply applying the function \\( f \\) to each eigenvalue of \\( A \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a simple example to illustrate this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Matrix \\( A \\)**:\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   A = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "   2 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "   0 & 3\n",
    "   \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   The eigenvalues of $ ( A ) are ( \\lambda_1 = 2 ) and ( \\lambda_2 = 3 )$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function \\( f(x) = x^2 \\)**:\n",
    "   We want to find the eigenvalues of \\( $ f(A) = A^2 $\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Applying the Theorem**:\n",
    "   According to the Spectral Mapping Theorem, the eigenvalues of \\($ A^2 $\\) are \\( $f(\\lambda_1) = 2^2 = 4 $\\) and \\($ f(\\lambda_2) = 3^2 = 9 $ \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Verification**:\n",
    "   Let's compute \\( $ A^2 $ \\) to verify:\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   A^2 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "   2 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "   0 & 3\n",
    "   \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "   2 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "   0 & 3\n",
    "   \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "   4 & 5 \\\\\n",
    "   0 & 9\n",
    "   \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   The eigenvalues of \\( $ A^2 $ \\) are indeed 4 and 9, confirming the theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application in Multi-Agent Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of multi-agent systems, the Spectral Mapping Theorem is useful for analyzing the stability and dynamics of the system. For example, if you have a network of agents represented by a graph, the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix or Laplacian matrix can provide insights into the system's behavior. Applying functions to these matrices (like exponentiation for continuous-time systems) and using the Spectral Mapping Theorem helps in understanding how the system evolves over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2.5 To check Theorem 2.6, let us consider the following matrix: \n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   A = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "   0 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n",
    "   -1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "   -1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "   \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "   $$\n",
