    "\n",
    "### Perron–Frobenius Theory Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Perron–Frobenius theorem applies to nonnegative matrices (matrices with all entries being nonnegative). It provides important insights into the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these matrices, which are crucial in understanding the behavior of multi-agent systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points of the Perron–Frobenius Theorem:\n",
    "1. **Existence of a Positive Eigenvalue**: For a nonnegative matrix $ A $, there exists a real, positive eigenvalue $  \\lambda_{PF} $ (called the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue) which is the largest among all eigenvalues in magnitude.\n",
    "2. **Positive Eigenvector**: The eigenvector corresponding to $ $ \\lambda_{PF} $ $ has strictly positive components.\n",
    "3. **Uniqueness**: The Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue is unique, and the corresponding eigenvector is unique up to a positive scalar multiple.\n",
    "4. **Dominance**: Any other eigenvalue $  \\lambda $  of $ A $ satisfies $  |\\lambda| \\leq \\lambda_{PF}  $.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The difference between a positive matrix and a non-negative matrix lies in the values of their elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Negative Matrix\n",
    "A **non-negative matrix** is a matrix in which all the elements are equal to or greater than zero. Formally, if $ A $ is a non-negative matrix, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ A = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "a_{11} & a_{12} & \\cdots & a_{1n} \\\\\n",
    "a_{21} & a_{22} & \\cdots & a_{2n} \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \\cdots & a_{mn}\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix} $\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ a_{ij} \\geq 0 $ for all $ i $ and $ j $.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Positive Matrix\n",
    "A **positive matrix** is a matrix in which all the elements are strictly greater than zero. Formally, if $ B $ is a positive matrix, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ B = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "b_{11} & b_{12} & \\cdots & b_{1n} \\\\\n",
    "b_{21} & b_{22} & \\cdots & b_{2n} \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "b_{m1} & b_{m2} & \\cdots & b_{mn}\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix} $\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ b_{ij} > 0 $ for all $ i $ and $ j $.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences\n",
    "1. **Element Values**:\n",
    "   - **Non-Negative Matrix**: Elements can be zero or positive.\n",
    "   - **Positive Matrix**: Elements must be strictly positive (greater than zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Examples**:\n",
    "   - **Non-Negative Matrix**:\n",
    "     $ \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "     0 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n",
    "     1 & 0 & 4 \\\\\n",
    "     5 & 6 & 0\n",
    "     \\end{pmatrix} $\n",
    "   - **Positive Matrix**:\n",
    "     $ \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "     1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n",
    "     4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n",
    "     7 & 8 & 9\n",
    "     \\end{pmatrix} $\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "- **Non-Negative Matrices**: Commonly used in probability, statistics, and various optimization problems where non-negativity constraints are essential.\n",
    "- **Positive Matrices**: Often appear in contexts where all interactions or values must be strictly positive, such as certain economic models or biological systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these differences is crucial in fields like control theory, graph theory, and multi-agent systems, where the properties of matrices influence the behavior and stability of the systems being studied.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application in Multi-Agent Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In multi-agent systems, agents often need to reach a consensus or coordinate their actions based on local interactions. The Perron–Frobenius theorem helps in analyzing the convergence properties of these systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Consensus Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a network of agents represented by a graph, where the adjacency matrix $ A $ describes the connections between agents. Each agent $ i $ updates its state $ x_i $ based on the states of its neighbors. The update rule can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$  x_i(t+1) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij} x_j(t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $$ a_{ij} $$ are the entries of the adjacency matrix $ A $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Perron–Frobenius theorem, we can analyze the convergence of this update rule. If $ A $ is a nonnegative matrix and the graph is strongly connected (i.e., there is a path between any pair of nodes), the system will converge to a consensus state. The consensus value is determined by the Perron-Frobenius eigenvector.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Distributed Averaging\n",
    "\n",
    "In a distributed averaging problem, each agent starts with an initial value and iteratively updates its value to the average of its neighbors' values. This can be modeled using a stochastic matrix $ P $ (a nonnegative matrix where each row sums to 1):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x(t+1) = P x(t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $ x(t) $ is the vector of agents' states at time $ t $. The Perron–Frobenius theorem ensures that if $ P $ is irreducible and aperiodic, the system will converge to a steady state where all agents have the same value, which is the average of the initial values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sure! Let's go through a detailed example of how Perron–Frobenius Theory can be applied in a multi-agent consensus problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Consensus in a Network of Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we have a network of 4 agents, and the goal is for all agents to agree on a common value through local interactions. The network can be represented by the following adjacency matrix $ A $:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ A = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "0 & 1 & 1 & 0\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $ ( a_{ij} = 1 ) $ if there is a connection between agent $ i $ and agent $ j $, and $ a_{ij} = 0 $ otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial States**:\n",
    "   Each agent starts with an initial state. Let's assume the initial states are:\n",
    "   $ x(0) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "   1 \\\\\n",
    "   2 \\\\\n",
    "   3 \\\\\n",
    "   4\n",
    "   \\end{pmatrix} $\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Update Rule**:\n",
    "   Each agent updates its state based on the average of its neighbors' states. The update rule can be written as:\n",
    "   $ x(t+1) = \\frac{1}{d_i} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij} x_j(t) $\n",
    "   where $ d_i $ is the degree of node $ i $ (the number of connections it has).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Degree Matrix**:\n",
    "   The degree matrix $ D $ is a diagonal matrix where $ d_i $ is the degree of node $ i $:\n",
    "   $ D = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "   2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "   0 & 3 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "   0 & 0 & 3 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "   0 & 0 & 0 & 2\n",
    "   \\end{pmatrix} $\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Normalized Adjacency Matrix**:\n",
    "   The normalized adjacency matrix $ P $ is given by:\n",
    "   $ P = D^{-1} A = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "   0 & 0.5 & 0.5 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "   0.333 & 0 & 0.333 & 0.333 \\\\\n",
    "   0.333 & 0.333 & 0 & 0.333 \\\\\n",
    "   0 & 0.5 & 0.5 & 0\n",
    "   \\end{pmatrix} $\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Iteration**:\n",
    "   We iterate the update rule to see how the states evolve over time. For simplicity, let's compute the states for a few iterations:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Iteration 1**:\n",
    "     $ x(1) = P x(0) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "     0 & 0.5 & 0.5 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "     0.333 & 0 & 0.333 & 0.333 \\\\\n",
    "     0.333 & 0.333 & 0 & 0.333 \\\\\n",
    "     0 & 0.5 & 0.5 & 0\n",
    "     \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "     1 \\\\\n",
    "     2 \\\\\n",
    "     3 \\\\\n",
    "     4\n",
    "     \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "     2.5 \\\\\n",
    "     2.333 \\\\\n",
    "     2.333 \\\\\n",
    "     2.5\n",
    "     \\end{pmatrix} $\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Iteration 2**:\n",
    "     $ x(2) = P x(1) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "     0 & 0.5 & 0.5 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "     0.333 & 0 & 0.333 & 0.333 \\\\\n",
    "     0.333 & 0.333 & 0 & 0.333 \\\\\n",
    "     0 & 0.5 & 0.5 & 0\n",
    "     \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}\n",

    "     2.5\n",
    "     \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "     2.333 \\\\\n",
    "     2.444 \\\\\n",
    "     2.444 \\\\\n",
    "     2.333\n",
    "     \\end{pmatrix} $\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Iteration 3**:\n",
    "     $ x(3) = P x(2) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "     0 & 0.5 & 0.5 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "     0.333 & 0 & 0.333 & 0.333 \\\\\n",
    "     0.333 & 0.333 & 0 & 0.333 \\\\\n",
    "     0 & 0.5 & 0.5 & 0\n",
    "     \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "     2.333 \\\\\n",
    "     2.444 \\\\\n",
    "     2.444 \\\\\n",
    "     2.333\n",
    "     \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "     2.444 \\\\\n",
    "     2.407 \\\\\n",
    "     2.407 \\\\\n",
    "     2.444\n",
    "     \\end{pmatrix} $\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "As we continue iterating, the states of all agents will converge to the same value. This value is the average of the initial states, which is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\text{Average} = \\frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4}{4} = 2.5 $\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how the Perron–Frobenius theorem ensures that the consensus algorithm converges to a common value. The largest eigenvalue of the normalized adjacency matrix $ P $ is 1, and the corresponding eigenvector indicates the steady-state distribution of the agents' states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to ask if you have more questions or need further clarification!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The Perron–Frobenius theorem provides a powerful tool for analyzing the stability and convergence of multi-agent systems. By understanding the properties of the largest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector, we can predict the behavior of consensus algorithms and other coordination strategies in multi-agent networks.\n"
