    "### **3.1.1 Consensus Problem in Multi-Agent Systems**\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Consensus Problem\" in the context of multi-agent systems is a fundamental topic that deals with how a group of agents can reach an agreement on a certain quantity of interest. Here’s a comprehensive explanation with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **a. Definition** :\n",
    "  - Consensus means that all agents in a multi-agent system agree on a certain state or value. This is crucial for coordinated behavior in  systems like autonomous vehicles, robotic swarms, and sensor networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **b. System Dynamics**\n",
    "Consider a multi-agent system with $ n $ agents. The dynamics of each agent $ i $ are given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dot{x}_i(t) = f_i(x_i(t), u_i(t))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $ x_i(t) $ is the state and $ u_i(t) $ is the control input of agent $ i $.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **c. Information Exchange**\n",
    "  - Each agent can communicate with a subset of other agents, known as its neighbors. The set of neighbors for agent $ i $ is denoted by $ \\mathcal{N}_i $.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **d. Graph Representation**\n",
    "  - The communication network is represented by a graph $ G = (\\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{E}) $, where $ \\mathcal{V} $ is the set of agents and $ \\mathcal{E} $ is the set of edges representing communication links.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **e. Control Law**\n",
    "The control input for each agent is designed based on the information from its neighbors. Two common types of control laws are:\n",
    "- **Absolute-state-based**: $ u_i(t) = g_i(x_i(t), [x_j(t)]_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}_i}) $\n",
    "- **Relative-state-based**: $ u_i(t) = h_i([x_j(t) - x_i(t)]_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}_i}) $\n",
    "- The latter is exploited when the information of each agent is limited to the relative value of its state with respect to neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **f. Convergence**\n",
    "  - The goal is to design the control laws such that the states of all agents converge to a common value. The convergence properties are often analyzed using the graph Laplacian for continuous-time systems or the Perron matrix for discrete-time systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1.2 Consensus Value**\n",
    "\n",
    "The consensus value in the context of the \"Consensus Problem\" refers to the common state or value that all agents in a multi-agent system aim to agree upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **a. Definition**\n",
    "The consensus value is the final agreed-upon state that all agents in the system converge to. This value is crucial for ensuring coordinated behavior among the agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **b. Mathematical Formulation**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **(1) Continuous-Time Systems**:\n",
    "For a continuous-time multi-agent system, the consensus problem can be formulated using the following differential equation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dot{x}_i(t) = -\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}_i} a_{ij} (x_i(t) - x_j(t))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ x_i(t) $ is the state of agent $ i $ at time $ t $.\n",
    "- $ \\mathcal{N}_i $ is the set of neighbors of agent $ i $.\n",
    "- $ a_{ij} $ are the weights of the communication links.\n",
    "\n",
    "The consensus value $ x^* $ is achieved when:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} x_i(t) = x^* \\quad \\forall i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "Consider three agents with initial states $ x_1(0) = 1 $, $ x_2(0) = 3 $, and $ x_3(0) = 5 $. If they communicate with equal weights, the consensus value $ x^* $ will be the average of the initial states:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x^* = \\frac{1 + 3 + 5}{3} = 3\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **(2). Discrete-Time Systems**:\n",
    "For discrete-time systems, the consensus problem can be formulated using the following update rule:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x_i(k+1) = x_i(k) + \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}_i} b_{ij} (x_j(k) - x_i(k))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ x_i(k) $ is the state of agent $ i $ at time step $ k $.\n",
    "- $ b_{ij} $ are the weights of the communication links.\n",
    "\n",
    "The consensus value $ x^* $ is achieved when:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} x_i(k) = x^* \\quad \\forall i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "Consider a network of four sensors with initial measurements $ x_1(0) = 2 $, $ x_2(0) = 4 $, $ x_3(0) = 6 $, and $ x_4(0) = 8 $. If they update their measurements based on their neighbors, the consensus value $ x^* $ will be the average of the initial measurements:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x^* = \\frac{2 + 4 + 6 + 8}{4} = 5\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **c. Consensus Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of consensus values that agents might aim to achieve:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **(1) Average Consensus**\n",

    "  $$\n",
    "  where $ x_i(0) $ is the initial state of agent $ i $ and $ n $ is the total number of agents.\n",
    "- **Example**: If three agents have initial states $ x_1(0) = 2 $, $ x_2(0) = 4 $, and $ x_3(0) = 6 $, the average consensus value is:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  x^* = \\frac{2 + 4 + 6}{3} = 4\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "- **Properties**:\n",
    "  - **Convergence**: Agents converge to the average of their initial states.\n",

    "  - **Applications**: Used in distributed averaging, sensor networks, and load balancing.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **(2) Weighted Average Consensus**\n",
    "- **Definition**: The consensus value is a weighted average of the initial states of all agents, where different agents may have different weights.\n",
    "- **Mathematical Formulation**:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  x^* = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i(0)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  where $ w_i $ is the weight assigned to agent $ i $.\n",
    "- **Example**: If three agents have initial states $ x_1(0) = 2 $, $ x_2(0) = 4 $, and $ x_3(0) = 6 $ with weights $ w_1 = 1 $, $ w_2 = 2 $, and $ w_3 = 3 $, the weighted average consensus value is:\n",
    "  $$\n",

    "\n",
    "##### **(4) Max-Min Consensus**\n",
