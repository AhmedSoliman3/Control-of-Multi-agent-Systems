    "## **3.1 Consensus Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Consensus Problem\" in the context of multi-agent systems is a fundamental topic that deals with how a group of agents can reach an agreement on a certain quantity of interest. Here’s a comprehensive explanation with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Definition** :\n",
    "  - Consensus means that all agents in a multi-agent system agree on a certain state or value. This is crucial for coordinated behavior in  systems like autonomous vehicles, robotic swarms, and sensor networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. System Dynamics**\n",
    "Consider a multi-agent system with $ n $ agents. The dynamics of each agent $ i $ are given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dot{x}_i(t) = f_i(x_i(t), u_i(t))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $ x_i(t) $ is the state and $ u_i(t) $ is the control input of agent $ i $.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Information Exchange**\n",
    "  - Each agent can communicate with a subset of other agents, known as its neighbors. The set of neighbors for agent $ i $ is denoted by $ \\mathcal{N}_i $.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Graph Representation**\n",
    "  - The communication network is represented by a graph $ G = (\\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{E}) $, where $ \\mathcal{V} $ is the set of agents and $ \\mathcal{E} $ is the set of edges representing communication links.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Control Law**\n",
    "The control input for each agent is designed based on the information from its neighbors. Two common types of control laws are:\n",
    "- **Absolute-state-based**: $ u_i(t) = g_i(x_i(t), [x_j(t)]_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}_i}) $\n",
    "- **Relative-state-based**: $ u_i(t) = h_i([x_j(t) - x_i(t)]_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}_i}) $\n",
    "- The latter is exploited when the information of each agent is limited to the relative value of its state with respect to neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Convergence**\n",
    "  - The goal is to design the control laws such that the states of all agents converge to a common value. The convergence properties are often analyzed using the graph Laplacian for continuous-time systems or the Perron matrix for discrete-time systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Consensus Value**\n",
    "\n",
    "The consensus value in the context of the \"Consensus Problem\" refers to the common state or value that all agents in a multi-agent system aim to agree upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **a. Definition**\n",
    "The consensus value is the final agreed-upon state that all agents in the system converge to. This value is crucial for ensuring coordinated behavior among the agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **b. Consensus Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of consensus values that agents might aim to achieve:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **(1) Average Consensus**\n",
    "- **Definition**: The consensus value is the average of the initial states of all agents.\n",
    "- **Mathematical Formulation**:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  x^* = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i(0)\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  where $ x_i(0) $ is the initial state of agent $ i $ and $ n $ is the total number of agents.\n",
    "- **Example**: If three agents have initial states $ x_1(0) = 2 $, $ x_2(0) = 4 $, and $ x_3(0) = 6 $, the average consensus value is:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  x^* = \\frac{2 + 4 + 6}{3} = 4\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "- **Properties**:\n",
    "  - **Convergence**: Agents converge to the average of their initial states.\n",
    "  - **Robustness**: Generally robust to changes in network topology.\n",
    "  - **Applications**: Used in distributed averaging, sensor networks, and load balancing.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **(2) Weighted Average Consensus**\n",
    "- **Definition**: The consensus value is a weighted average of the initial states of all agents, where different agents may have different weights.\n",
    "- **Mathematical Formulation**:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  x^* = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i(0)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  where $ w_i $ is the weight assigned to agent $ i $.\n",
    "- **Example**: If three agents have initial states $ x_1(0) = 2 $, $ x_2(0) = 4 $, and $ x_3(0) = 6 $ with weights $ w_1 = 1 $, $ w_2 = 2 $, and $ w_3 = 3 $, the weighted average consensus value is:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  x^* = \\frac{1 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 4 + 3 \\cdot 6}{1 + 2 + 3} = \\frac{2 + 8 + 18}{6} = 4.67\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **(3) Median Consensus**\n",
    "- **Definition**: The consensus value is the median of the initial states of all agents.\n",
    "- **Mathematical Formulation**: The median is the middle value when the initial states are sorted in ascending order.\n",
    "- **Example**: If five agents have initial states $ x_1(0) = 1 $, $ x_2(0) = 3 $, $ x_3(0) = 5 $, $ x_4(0) = 7 $, and $ x_5(0) = 9 $, the median consensus value is:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  x^* = 5\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **(4) Max-Min Consensus**\n",
    "- **Definition**: The consensus value is either the maximum or minimum of the initial states of all agents.\n",
    "- **Mathematical Formulation**:\n",
    "  - **Max Consensus**: $ x^* = \\max(x_1(0), x_2(0), \\ldots, x_n(0)) $\n",
    "  - **Min Consensus**: $ x^* = \\min(x_1(0), x_2(0), \\ldots, x_n(0)) $\n",
    "- **Example**: If four agents have initial states $ x_1(0) = 2 $, $ x_2(0) = 8 $, $ x_3(0) = 5 $, and $ x_4(0) = 3 $:\n",
    "  - Max Consensus: $ x^* = 8 $\n",
    "  - Min Consensus: $ x^* = 2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Properties**:\n",
    "  - **Convergence**: Agents converge to the maximum or minimum initial state.\n",
    "  - **Robustness**: Sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "  - **Applications**: Used in distributed optimization and resource allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **(5) Mode Consensus**\n",
    "- **Definition**: The consensus value is the mode of the initial states, which is the value that appears most frequently.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### **(7) Leader–Follower Consensus**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: A subset of agents (leaders) influence the rest of the agents (followers).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mathematical Formulation**:\n",
    "  $ x_i(t+1) = x_i(t) + \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}_i} a_{ij} (x_j(t) - x_i(t)) + b_i (x_L(t) - x_i(t)) $\n",
